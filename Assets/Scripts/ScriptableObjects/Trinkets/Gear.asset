  description: 'Reduces bullet spread of the shotgun.


    A rusted, old cog. Its
    surface has long deteriorated since its time above, but its edges still carry
    the evidence of a partnership once struck. Two pieces, inextricably bound, ever
    turning together. Its other half is nowhere to be found, likely lost to the void
    above. '
